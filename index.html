			<ul class="glossary">
				<li><strong>Starts/Cuttings:</strong> (noun) Juvenile plants, typically purchased from a nursery or garden
					store. A nursery has already done the work of getting the seeds to sprout in a greenhouse and getting the
					plant old enough to survive being planted outside in your garden.</li>
				<li><strong>Transplant:</strong> (verb) When you take your start (obtained either from the store or from a
					seed you grew yourself) and remove it from it's smaller container and plant it in the garden bed. Pre-dig
					the hole it will go in and make sure it is a little deeper than the pot your start came in. While holding
					your start over your hole, turn the start upside down and gently shake or squeeze the pot to coax the
					start out. Any nutrient and fertilizer-rich soil will drop down into the hole where that plant can still
					benefit from it! Place your start into the hole, being careful not to smash the roots. Use soil to fill
					in around the plant, adding a bit more around the stem (fresh soil often compacts when watered so it is a
					good idea to bring the soil a little higher around the plant than it was before).</li>
				<li><strong>Spacing:</strong> (noun) Refers to the space a plant needs when full grown. Seeds and starts are
					small but often grow into mighty plants! You should consider planting your starts with as much space
					between them and other plants as is suggested.
					<br>NOTE For seeds: Not all seeds will grow and thrive. Seed packets may suggest sowing the seeds close
					together and then thinning.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Thinning:</strong> (verb) The process of pulling the less-healthy sprouts around the healthier
					sprouts. Ultimately you want your sprouts that stay to have the recommended spacing for a fully grown
					plant.</li>
				<li><strong>Sowing:</strong> (verb) This relates to planting from seeds and refers to placing the seeds
					directly in the ground. Pay attention to the planting depth! Some seeds need to have more dirt over the
					top of them than others.</li>
				<li><strong>Sun:</strong> (noun) Different plants require different amounts of light during the day to grow.
					Here is a breakdown of what you might see, keep in mind these times refer to the time sun is shining
					directly on that plant, not how many hours of daylight you have!
					<ul class="subGlossary">
						<li><strong>Full Sun:</strong> 6 or more hours of direct sun per day.</li>
						<li><strong>Part Sun:</strong> 4 to 6 hours of direct sun per day, including some afternoon sun.</li>
						<li><strong>Part Shade:</strong> 4 to 6 hours of sun per day, mostly before midday.</li>
						<li><strong>Full Shade:</strong> Less than 4 hours of direct sun per day.</li>
					</ul>
